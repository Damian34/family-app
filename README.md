Family REST API
====================

it is simple api to store some like family data by names and its members

The api is using libraries:
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Flyway
- Postgres
- Thymeleaf (only to call custom error page)
- Junit5
- etc.

the api can runs with docker,\
i personally use intellij docker plugin that allow me in docker-composer.yaml eg.\
to smoothly let me run only postgres image to run api locally, but can also run full at docker.
